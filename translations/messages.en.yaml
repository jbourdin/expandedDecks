            title: Community tool — not an official service
            body: >
                Expanded Decks is an independent community project designed to promote
                the Expanded format and make it easier for new players to try it by
                borrowing decks at events. This tool does not replace or compete with
                official Pokemon Organized Play services. By creating or updating an
                event here, you confirm that you will comply with all official Pokemon
                tournament rules and policies. The tournament ID is used solely for
                cross-referencing — this platform has no affiliation with The Pokemon
                Company.
