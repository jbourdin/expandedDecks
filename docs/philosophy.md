## Why Expanded Decks Exists

The **Expanded format** is one of the richest and most creative ways to play the Pokemon Trading Card Game. With a card pool stretching back to Black & White, it offers incredible deck diversity and deep strategic possibilities — but that same depth can be a barrier for players discovering the format for the first time.

Building a competitive Expanded deck requires cards that may be out of print, hard to find, or expensive to acquire. For a player who has only ever played Standard, the jump can feel overwhelming: unfamiliar cards, unfamiliar combos, and a significant upfront investment just to try something new.

**Expanded Decks** was created to lower that barrier.

## Our Mission

We believe that the best way to grow the Expanded community is to make it **easy to try**. This project enables players who already own Expanded decks to **share them** with others at organized events — safely, traceably, and without friction.

By lending a deck for a tournament, an experienced player gives a newcomer the chance to play a real, competitive list without buying a single card. That first positive experience — playing a format they couldn't access on their own — is often all it takes to spark a lasting interest.

### Core Principles

- **Promote the Expanded format.** Every feature in this project exists to make Expanded events more accessible and more enjoyable. We want more players at Expanded tournaments, more deck variety on the floor, and more people discovering why this format is worth playing.

- **Share decks, share knowledge.** A shared deck library isn't just about physical cards — it's about decklists, archetypes, and the conversations that happen when a veteran lends a deck and explains how it works. We encourage owners to share their lists publicly so that others can learn, adapt, and build their own versions over time.

- **Lower the entry barrier for new players.** The format shouldn't be gatekept by card availability. A player who shows up to an Expanded tournament shouldn't have to sit out because they don't own a deck yet. With this tool, organizers and community members can ensure that anyone who wants to play can play.

- **Support organizers and communities.** Running an Expanded event takes effort. This project provides organizers with tools to manage deck lending logistics, track custody, and coordinate with staff — so they can focus on running great tournaments instead of juggling spreadsheets.

## What This Project Is Not

**Expanded Decks is a community tool, not a substitute for official services.**

- This project does **not** replace or compete with the official Pokemon Organized Play infrastructure. It does not handle tournament registration, pairings, standings, or any function managed by The Pokemon Company's tournament software.

- Event creation in this app references official tournament IDs for traceability, but the app has **no official affiliation** with The Pokemon Company, Play! Pokemon, or any related entity.

- All usage of Pokemon-related data (card names, set codes, images via TCGdex) is for **informational and community purposes** within the bounds of fan use. We respect the intellectual property of The Pokemon Company, Nintendo, Creatures Inc., and GAME FREAK.

- Users and organizers are expected to **comply with all official Pokemon Organized Play rules and policies**, including but not limited to deck registration requirements, proxy policies, and tournament conduct guidelines. This tool facilitates deck lending — it does not override any rule set by the tournament organizer or The Pokemon Company.

- Player data collected by this application is handled in accordance with applicable privacy regulations (see [GDPR features](features.md#f1--user-management)). We do not share personal data with third parties.

## In Practice

A typical Expanded Decks workflow looks like this:

1. A player who owns several Expanded decks **registers them** in the library, imports the deck lists, and prints labels for their deck boxes.
2. An organizer **creates an upcoming event** (linked to the official tournament ID) and assigns a staff team.
3. Other players browse the deck library, find an archetype they'd like to try, and **request to borrow** a deck for the event.
4. The deck owner approves the request. At the event, the deck is **handed off** — scanned in and tracked.
5. After the tournament, the deck is **returned** and scanned back. The borrower had a great time playing Expanded — and maybe they'll start building their own deck next.

That cycle — try, enjoy, invest — is how communities grow. This project exists to make it happen.
