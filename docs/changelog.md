*Nothing yet.*

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-08

Phase 7 completion — Engagement, Results & Discovery: deck event status overview, tournament results with monospace short-ID badges, and Pokemon event page sync.

### Deck Library

- **F2.14** — Deck event status overview *(completed)*: deck detail page now shows a summary of the deck's participation across events — engagement state, borrow status, and tournament placement at a glance.

### Event Management

- **F3.17** — Tournament results *(completed)*: dedicated results page with placement and match records. Player short-IDs displayed as monospace badges. First/last name shown alongside screen name.
- **F3.18** — Sync from Pokemon event page *(completed)*: import event metadata (name, date, location, structure) from a Pokemon event page URL. Maps tournament structures (League Challenge → swiss), handles unicode decoding, and includes functional test coverage.

### Cross-Cutting

- 460 tests, PHPStan level 10
- Phase 7 fully complete (10/10 features done)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-05

Phase 7 progress — Engagement, Results & Discovery: event lifecycle completion, visibility controls, engagement states, event discovery, event notifications with per-type user preferences.

### Event Management

- **F3.7** — Register played deck for event *(completed)*: tournament result fields (`placement`, `matchRecord`) on `EventDeckEntry`, with full CRUD on the event show page.
- **F3.10** — Cancel an event *(completed)*: cancellation action with async cascading borrow cancellation via Messenger (`CancelEventBorrowsMessage`). Pending and approved borrows are cancelled; lent/overdue borrows are preserved.
- **F3.11** — Event visibility: public, private, and invitation-only events. `EventVisibility` enum with `visibility` column on `Event`. Invitation-only events restrict player registration to invited users.
- **F3.13** — Player engagement states *(completed)*: full engagement lifecycle — interested, registered (playing/spectating), invited, withdrawn. Invitation-only flag, invite action for organizers, and preserved invitation status across mode switches.
- **F3.15** — Event discovery: public discovery page listing upcoming public events with search, available to all users (including unauthenticated).
- **F3.20** — Mark event as finished *(completed)*: finish action sets `finishedAt`, blocks new borrow requests and registrations for finished events.

### Notifications

- **F8.2** — Event notifications *(completed)*: email and in-app notifications for staff assignment, event updates, event cancellation, and user invitations. Templated emails with recipient locale support.
- **F8.3** — Notification preferences: per-type email/in-app settings on `/profile/notifications`. JSON column on `User` (null = all enabled, backwards-compatible). Checkbox table grouped by category (Borrow / Event) with column-toggle headers. All notification services (`BorrowService`, `BorrowNotificationEmailService`, `EventNotificationService`, `StaffCustodyService`) check user preferences before sending.

### Cross-Cutting

- Notification preferences link added to user dropdown menu
- EN + FR translations for all new features (~350 new translation keys)
- 425 tests, PHPStan level 10

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-04

Phase 6 — Localization: multi-language support (en/fr), timezone-aware display, user profile page, and Gravatar navbar avatar.

### Localization

- **F9.1** — User language preference: Symfony locale listener detects user locale from session, user preference, or `Accept-Language` header. All UI strings render in the active locale.
- **F9.2** — User timezone display: `user_datetime` / `user_date` Twig filters convert UTC timestamps to the user's timezone with locale-aware formatting via `IntlDateFormatter`. Event dates display in the event's timezone with a tooltip showing the user's local time when different.
- **F9.3** — Application translation: all ~300 user-facing strings extracted to XLIFF catalogues (`messages.en.xlf`, `messages.fr.xlf`). Covers templates, controller flash messages, form labels, and email templates/subjects. Emails render in the recipient's preferred locale.
- **F9.4** — UTC datetime storage: event form uses `model_timezone` / `view_timezone` for automatic UTC conversion. PHP timezone set to UTC via `.symfony.local.yaml`.

### User Management

- **F1.3** — User profile page: edit screen name, player ID, preferred locale, and timezone. Locale changes apply immediately via `LocaleSwitcher`.
- **F1.11** — Gravatar avatar & navbar dropdown: 32px Gravatar avatar (64px Retina source) in the navbar with a Bootstrap dropdown menu (Dashboard, Profile, Logout).

### Cross-Cutting

- Abstract base controller (`AbstractAppController`) with auto-translating `addFlash()` for all controllers
- Bootstrap Icons and tooltip initialization for timezone display
- 363 tests, PHPStan level 10

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-04

Borrow workflow maturity: staff custody chain, conflict management, owner inbox, and UI refinements.

### Deck Library

- **F2.13** — Inline deck list import on creation: owners can import a deck list directly during deck creation, removing the need for a separate import step.

### Event Management

- **F3.21** — Clear deck selection on withdrawal: when a participant withdraws from an event or switches participation mode, their deck selection is automatically cleared.
- **F4.13** — Event-scoped autocompletes: user search fields in staff assignment and borrow workflows are scoped to event participants for faster results.

### Borrow Workflow

- **F4.5** — Borrow history: paginated borrow and lend lists with full deck detail (was *(partial)* in 0.1.0).
- **F4.9** — Staff deck custody tracking: staff members assigned to an event can manage delegated decks on the event page. Delegated staff can also cancel borrows on behalf of the deck owner.
- **F4.10** — Owner borrow inbox: grouped-by-event layout with inline approve/deny/cancel actions (was *(partial)* in 0.1.0).
- **F4.11** — Multiple pending borrow requests: a deck can receive multiple pending borrow requests per event, allowing the owner to compare and choose. When a borrow is approved or a walk-up lend is created, all other pending borrows for the same deck at that event are automatically declined via `DeclineCompetingBorrowsMessage` (async `borrow_lifecycle` Messenger transport).
- **F4.14** — Staff custody handover tracking: owners confirm handing a delegated deck to staff; staff confirm returning it. Tracks `staffReceivedAt`/`staffReceivedBy` and `staffReturnedAt`/`staffReturnedBy` on `EventDeckRegistration`. Full chain-of-custody visibility: owner → staff → borrower → staff → owner. Guard conditions: staff cannot hand off or walk-up lend a delegated deck until the owner confirms physical handover; delegation cannot be revoked while the deck is with staff.
- **F4.14** — Custody return rules: staff cannot mark a deck as returned to owner while it is currently lent to a borrower (must collect it first). When staff returns the deck, remaining active borrows (returned, pending, approved) are auto-closed. New owner reclaim action: the owner can mark "returned to me" at any time, closing both the custody tracking and all active borrows (including lent/overdue) in one step. Borrowers with active lent/overdue borrows are notified.
- **F4.14** — Deck selection UI: own decks that are currently lent or handed over to staff are shown as disabled rows in the Deck Selection card (with "Lent" / "With staff" badges) instead of being hidden. A "Browse decks" link invites the owner to borrow an alternative.

### Dashboard & Homepage

- **F7.1** — Dashboard: "See all" link added to My Decks section.

### Cross-Cutting

- Transaction rollback for functional test isolation (performance improvement)
- PHPUnit test suite expanded (46+ test methods, 1 600+ assertions)
